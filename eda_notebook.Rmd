**1. About this Competition**

This is the description about the data and the diagram explain the relationship between each data files
This was copied directly from kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data 


**application_{train|test}.csv**

This is the main table, broken into two files for Train (with TARGET) and Test (without TARGET).
Static data for all applications. One row represents one loan in our data sample.

**bureau.csv**

All client's previous credits provided by other financial institutions that were reported to Credit Bureau (for clients who have a loan in our sample).
For every loan in our sample, there are as many rows as number of credits the client had in Credit Bureau before the application date.

**bureau_balance.csv**

Monthly balances of previous credits in Credit Bureau.
This table has one row for each month of history of every previous credit reported to Credit Bureau - i.e the table has (#loans in sample * # of relative previous credits * # of months where we have some history observable for the previous credits) rows.

**POS_CASH_balance.csv**

Monthly balance snapshots of previous POS (point of sales) and cash loans that the applicant had with Home Credit.
This table has one row for each month of history of every previous credit in Home Credit (consumer credit and cash loans) related to loans in our sample - i.e. the table has (#loans in sample * # of relative previous credits * # of months in which we have some history observable for the previous credits) rows.

**credit_card_balance.csv**

Monthly balance snapshots of previous credit cards that the applicant has with Home Credit.
This table has one row for each month of history of every previous credit in Home Credit (consumer credit and cash loans) related to loans in our sample - i.e. the table has (#loans in sample * # of relative previous credit cards * # of months where we have some history observable for the previous credit card) rows.

**previous_application.csv**

All previous applications for Home Credit loans of clients who have loans in our sample.
There is one row for each previous application related to loans in our data sample.

**installments_payments.csv**

Repayment history for the previously disbursed credits in Home Credit related to the loans in our sample.
There is a) one row for every payment that was made plus b) one row each for missed payment.
One row is equivalent to one payment of one installment OR one installment corresponding to one payment of one previous Home Credit credit related to loans in our sample.

**2. EDA train and test data **

reading the  train and test data
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
trainLocation <- "data/application_train.csv"
testLocation <- "data/application_test.csv"
library(tidyverse)
trainData <- read_csv(trainLocation)
testData <- read_csv(testLocation)
```


```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
trainData
```
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
testData
```
There are around 307511 observations in the train data set and 48744 observation in the tests data set so around 14% of the data is used as test data and 86% is train data. Train data and test data have 121 features, extra 1 target variable in train data. Most features are numeric with type integer and double, some of them are categorical with type character. There are also a lot of NA in the data


Check if there are any constant features in train data so we can remove
```{r}
library(dplyr)
trainData %>% summarise_all(funs(n_distinct(.)))
```

Seem like every features have at least 2 distinct value so no constant value


*Process numeric features*
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyimpute)
# get the absolute value of numberic feature
numSet1 <- trainData %>% keep(is.numeric) %>% abs 
# replace missing value with the median value of the feature
numSetNoNa <- numSet1 %>% impute_median()  
numSetNoNa
```

```{r}
summary(numSetNoNa)
```
numSetNoNa contain 106 features including the target variable. This data have no missing value



*Process Categorical features*


```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
# get the categorical features
catSet <- trainData %>% keep(is.character)
# use the mode of each features to replace its missing value
catSetNoNa <- catSet %>% impute_most_freq
# label encoding categorical features
catSetFactor <- catSetNoNa %>% mutate_all(funs(as.factor))
catSetLabelEncode <- catSetFactor %>% mutate_all(funs(as.numeric))
catSetLabelEncode
```


*Plotting*

Create two functions for plotting that we use later
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}

plotDistribtuion <- function(data,plot_type){
    data %>%
    gather() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(value)) + 
    facet_wrap(~key,scales = "free") + 
    plot_type()
}

plotDistribtuionCoordFlip <- function(data,plot_type){
    data %>%
    gather() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(value)) + 
    facet_wrap(~key,scales = "free") + 
    plot_type() + coord_flip()
}

```


We are splitting the numeric features into smaller chunk for plotting
```{r}
NumCol_1 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(1:9)
NumCol_2 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(10:19)
NumCol_3 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(20:29)
NumCol_4 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(30:39)
NumCol_5 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(40:49)
NumCol_6 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(50:59)
NumCol_7 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(60:69)
NumCol_8 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(70:79)
NumCol_9 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(80:89)
NumCol_10 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(90:99)
NumCol_11 <- numSetNoNa %>% select(100:106)
```

Plot histogram of numeric features
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE,fig.width=20,fig.height=10,out.width="1920px",out.height="1080px"}
plotDistribtuion((NumCol_1),geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_2,geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_3,geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_4,geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_5,geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_6,geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_7,geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_8,geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_9,geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_10,geom_histogram)
plotDistribtuion(NumCol_11,geom_histogram)
```
we have a lot of right skew features and binary features




We are splitting the categorical features into smaller chunk for plotting
```{r}
mutiTypeCol <- c("NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE","NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE","NAME_FAMILY_STATUS","NAME_HOUSING_TYPE","NAME_INCOME_TYPE","NAME_TYPE_SUITE","OCCUPATION_TYPE","WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START","FONDKAPREMONT_MODE","WALLSMATERIAL_MODE","HOUSETYPE_MODE")
catCol1 <- catSetNoNa %>% select(mutiTypeCol)
catCol2 <- catSetNoNa %>% select(-mutiTypeCol,-"ORGANIZATION_TYPE")
catCol3 <- catSetNoNa %>% select("ORGANIZATION_TYPE")
```

Plot bar chart of numeric features
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE,fig.width=20,fig.height=8,out.width="1920px",out.height="1080px"}
plotDistribtuionCoordFlip(catCol1,geom_bar)
plotDistribtuion(catCol2,geom_bar)
plotDistribtuionCoordFlip(catCol3,geom_bar)

```




We picks some features that we think it is important to graph the correlation 
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE,fig.width=20,fig.height=8,out.width="1920px",out.height="1080px"}
corFeatures <- numSetNoNa %>% select(TARGET,CNT_CHILDREN,AMT_INCOME_TOTAL,AMT_CREDIT,AMT_ANNUITY,AMT_GOODS_PRICE,CNT_FAM_MEMBERS,OBS_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE,DEF_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE,OBS_60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE,DEF_60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE)


library(corrplot)
M <- round(cor(corFeatures),2)
corrplot(M, method = "number")
```
If two features are highly correlated to each other we can remove one of them later when building the model

```{r}
readyData <- cbind(numSetNoNa,catSetLabelEncode)
library(caret)
numOnly <- readyData %>% keep(is.numeric)
which(is.na(numOnly), arr.ind=TRUE)

numOnly[266367, 11]


write.csv(readyData, file = "data/trainReady.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```
make test data ready like we did with train data
```{r}
testNumSet <- testData %>% keep(is.numeric) %>% abs
testNumSetNoNa <- testNumSet %>% impute_median() 

testCatSet <- testData %>% keep(is.character)
testCatSetNoNa <- testCatSet %>% impute_most_freq

testCatSetFactor <- testCatSetNoNa %>% mutate_all(funs(as.factor))
testCatSetLabelEncode <- testCatSetFactor %>% mutate_all(funs(as.numeric))

readyTestData <- cbind(testNumSetNoNa,testCatSetLabelEncode)
write.csv(readyTestData, file = "data/testReady.csv",row.names=FALSE)

```
